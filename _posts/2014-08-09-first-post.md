Hello and welcome to my blog!  My name is Will Oakley, and I am an applied math PhD student at UCLA.  This blog will not be like your usual math blogs.  As someone who appreciates the beauty of math but who lacks *sitzfleisch*, this blog will be about the uses of math in technology, or more generally, viewing *first world problems* through a mathematician's eyes.

Here is a list of possible topics for future posts:

  * Analog computing and AI
  * Simulation and computer vision
  * Modeling platonic relationships
  * Personalized programming
  * Computers and relativity
